## PASSENGER COUNTER APP

* This is the beginning of my learning journey of frontend software engineering for blockchain development.

* As a pilot,  I decided to code along with [Per Harald Borgen](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) toget to understand the various first principles of software engineering on the frontend. 

* Most of the work here is not my original work as I learn how to learn by getting my hands dirty and not parsing through tutorial docs and videos.


**Disclaimer** 
- This project is a practice project and should not be recognized as one of my portfolio projects..

### Learnings 
-  Create a function (you decide the name) that logs out the number 42 to the console
-  Call/invoke the function

``` 
function num() {
     console.log(42)
 }

num()
```

- Create function that adds laps times.
- Log the answer out 
- Call the function to display the answer
```
let lap1 = 34
let lap2 = 33
let lap3 = 36

function lapsums() {
let totallaptimes=lap1 +lap2 + lap3


console.log(totallaptimes)
**OR**
    _console.log(lap1+lap2+lap3)_
}

lapsums()
```



# LFG!!!!!
