### PASSENGER COUNTER APP

* This is the beginning of my learning journey of frontend software engineering for blockchain development.

* As a pilot,  I decided to code along with [Per Harald Borgen](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) toget to understand the various first principles of software engineering on the frontend. 

* Most of the work here is not my original work as I learn how to learn by getting my hands dirty and not parsing through tutorial docs and videos.

- This project is a practice project and should not be recognized as one of my portfolio projects..
